# Blog-to-Social Media Auto-Poster  

## About  
This project automates social media content creation by:  
1. Extracting key points from published blogs using **ChatGPT**.  
2. Formatting posts for each platformâ€™s requirements (e.g., X/Twitter character limits).  
3. Publishing to linked social accounts with **one-click approval**.  

Built for creators and marketers to save time and maintain consistent cross-platform engagement.

## Tools & Platforms Used  
- **Make.com** (automation)  
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)** (content summarization/adaptation)  
- **X (Twitter) API** (posting)  
- **Webhooks** (trigger from blog CMS)  

## How It Works  
1. **Trigger**: New blog post detected (via RSS/webhook or manual input).  
2. **AI Processing**: ChatGPT generates concise, platform-specific posts:  
   - Extracts key points.  
   - Adds hashtags/emojis.  
   - Ensures character limits (e.g., 280 for X).  
3. **Approval**: Posts await user review (optional) or auto-publish.  
4. **Publish**: Posts to linked social accounts.  

## Purpose & Problem Solved  
- **Saves 5+ hours/week** by eliminating manual copywriting.  
- **Improves engagement** with AI-optimized posts.  
- **Reduces errors** (auto-checks platform rules).  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- **No-code automation** (Make.com scenarios with conditional logic).  
- **AI integration** (prompt engineering for ChatGPT).  
- **Multi-platform APIs** (X/Twitter, with webhook handling).  
- **User experience design** (optional approval step).
